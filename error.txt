Plugin has disappeared: The plugin seems to have been installed but I don't know where. Probably the plugin package contained a wrong named directory.
             Please search the list of installed plugins. I'm nearly sure you'll find the plugin there, but I just can't determine which of them it is. It also means that I won't be able to determine if this plugin is installed and inform you about available updates. However the plugin may work. Please contact the plugin author and submit this issue.
